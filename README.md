# PowerBI_finalproject

This is the final project which I worked on at Generation Data Analytics Programme. I was responsible for the delivery analysis in the group project.

Project Description
Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian eCommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store has been provided to your company for analysis.

Your manager is asking you to analyse the provided dataset using your data analytics skills, prepare a PowerBI dashboard with visualisations that answer key questions, as well as prepare and present a final report.


Project Instructions
Your group is tasked with doing exploratory data analysis with the Olist Store dataset, to generate business insights and provide recommendations for improvement. You will need to use the results of your analysis to create a usable PowerBI dashboard with clear, concise, and informative data visualisations that drive recommended improvements for the client. You will present your results and recommendations in a final report (flexible format - can be a PowerPoint slide deck, a written document, etc).

The Olist Store dataset has information from 100,000 orders made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow you to view an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, and finally reviews written by customers. A geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates is also integrated into the dataset.

After a customer purchases a product from Olist Store, a seller gets notified to fulfil that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
